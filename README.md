# gatsby.js-tutorial

In this tutorial, I learned how to build and launch my first site with Gatsby. I built a website from scratch and learn how to get it deployed to production.

 I followed a video called [The Great Gatsby Bootcamp - Full Gatsby.js Tutorial Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzWIUX3CpuI&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbleDe3_ZA8h3AO2rXar-q2V&index=20&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) on the YouTube Chanel [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).
